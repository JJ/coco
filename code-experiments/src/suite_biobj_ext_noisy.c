/**
 * @file suite_biobj_ext.c
 * @brief Implementation of the extended biobjective bbob-biobj-ext suite containing 92 functions and 6 dimensions.
 *
 * The bbob-biobj-ext suite is created by combining two single-objective problems from the bbob suite.
 * The first 55 functions are the same as in the original bbob-biobj test suite to which 37 functions are added.
 * Those additional functions are constructed by combining all not yet contained in-group combinations (i,j) of
 * single-objective bbob functions i and j such that i<j (i.e. in particular not all combinations (i,i) are
 * included in this bbob-biobj-ext suite), with the exception of the Weierstrass function (f16) for which
 * the optimum is not unique and thus a nadir point is difficult to compute, see
 * http://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-biobj/functions/ for details.
 *
 * @note Because some bi-objective problems constructed from two single-objective ones have a single optimal
 * value, some care must be taken when selecting the instances. The already verified instances are stored in
 * suite_biobj_ext_instances. If a new instance of the problem is called, a check ensures that the two underlying
 * single-objective instances create a true bi-objective problem. However, these new instances need to be
 * manually added to suite_biobj_ext_instances, otherwise they will be computed each time the suite constructor
 * is invoked with these instances.
 *
 * @note This file is based on the original suite_bbob_biobj.c and extends it by 37 functions in 6 dimensions.

/**
 * @brief Returns the problem from the bbob-biobj-ext suite that corresponds to the given parameters.
 *
 * Creates the bi-objective problem by constructing it from two single-objective problems from the bbob
 * suite. If the invoked instance number is not in suite_biobj_ext_instances, the function uses the following
 * formula to construct a new appropriate instance:
 *
 *   problem1_instance = 2 * biobj_instance + 1
 *
 *   problem2_instance = problem1_instance + 1
 *
 * If needed, problem2_instance is increased (see also the explanation of suite_biobj_ext_get_new_instance).
 *
 * @param suite The COCO suite.
 * @param function_idx Index of the function (starting from 0).
 * @param dimension_idx Index of the dimension (starting from 0).
 * @param instance_idx Index of the instance (starting from 0).
 * @return The problem that corresponds to the given parameters.
 * @note Copied from suite_bbob_biobj.c and extended.
